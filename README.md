# Why bother anymore?

```r
devtools::install_github('kleinschmidt/fuckit.R')
```

Ignore errors.

```r
library(fuckit)
```

This is obviously a joke. Make sure you've saved anything in your workspace that you care about before running random code you downloaded from the internet.

Also, note that the philosophy of this package is very different from tools that actually _help_ you get work done like [fuckitjs](https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs) and [fuckit.py](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy).
